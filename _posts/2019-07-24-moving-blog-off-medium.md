We have moved our blog hosting from medium.com to our own servers.

This was done for several reasons:

1. Fine Grained control of Content+Hosting
2. Control of link and DNS security
3. Medium's paywall restrictions

>It is poor marketing to use a paywalled hosting and worse, direct traffic to a domain you do not control.

For this and many other reasons, we chose to use [Mediumish](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish) which also gives us additional abilities such as <span class="spoiler">embedding code samples easily.</span>

```javascript
console.log('Hello leverj!')
```

Over the coming days, we will migrate most of the old posts to the new site.
