### Leverj now on Ethereum Mainnet

I’m extremely proud of my team who have worked tirelessly for the past year to deliver the first high-speed non-custodial exchange: [https://live.leverj.io](https://live.leverj.io)

Nearly every financial crisis is linked to a small group of people having control over the wealth of a large number of people. From governments who debase their currency to financial institutions who mismanage or outright take private keys to the grave, the quintessential problem is **_custody_**.

Decentralized exchanges trade the custody problem for the friction problem. [Gluon Plasma](https://leverj.io/GluonPlasma.pdf) breaks this dilemma with a sidechain designed especially for trading.

#### Security Audits

While standard security measures such as [securing the site](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/live.leverj.io) with a solid content security policy and robust TLS are important, smart contract based systems are dependent on a thorough audit of the system.

Blockchain Labs has completed the [audit of Gluon Plasma contracts](https://leverj.io/auditreport.pdf) and all issues have been satisfactorily addressed.

#### Security Bounty

Our security bounty program is modified to payout USD. Security bounties complement security models and security audits and are an inherent part of security strategy.

#### The Road Ahead

A product is never done, always a work in progress. Although we are on mainnet, the product should still be considered beta. The UI needs a bit of TLC and the team will focus on usability over the next several weeks. Exposing the platform to users early helps drive priorities and gives users a voice in platform development.

On a plasma front, moving from POA to POS will mitigate the data availability problem and also decentralize the system, enabling multiple validators and exchanges (and other projects) to participate in the same sidechain. Fraud proofs will be added with support for multiple validators. We hope to welcome outside contributors and projects on Gluon Plasma, helping us build tooling, block explorers and support applications enabling a richer community.

On the product front, leveraged trading development will kick off, enabling creation of the first high-speed, non-custodial leveraged platform.

On the business development side, we will work on onboarding market makers and listing new tokens.
